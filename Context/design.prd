Hecto App - Product Requirements Document
=========================================

## Data Structure

User (personal identity)

## UI/UX Design System

### Responsive Layout Strategy

| Component | Desktop | Mobile |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Navigation | Icon sidebar (expandable) | Hamburger + slide-out drawer |
| Header | Search, notifications, avatar | Same, compact |
| Stat cards | 4 across in row | 2x2 grid or horizontal scroll |
| Action toolbar | Inline buttons | Sticky bar or FAB |
| Tabs | Horizontal | Scrollable horizontal |
| Data display | Table with columns | Card list (swipe actions) |
| Messages | 3-column layout | List → Thread → AI sheet |

### Design Inspiration
- Clean icon sidebar (see: dashboard-insp-campaignsLike.webp)
- Summary stat cards at top
- Data table with status badges and bulk actions
- Soft gray background, white cards
- Modal overlays for create/edit flows

### Key Principles
- Mobile-optimised: respond on the go
- Scan-friendly: stats and status visible at a glance
- Action-oriented: quick access to New Campaign, New Pitch
- Consistent status colors across all views
