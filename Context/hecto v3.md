PROJECT SUMMARY — GTM Partner Marketplace
Core Idea
A lightweight, curated board where founders, marketers & creators can post Go-To-Market partnership requests and offers, specifically to support product launches.

Founders post:

What they’re launching

What kind of exposure or collaboration they’re looking for (email swap, bundle, shoutout, collab product, rev-share, paid placement)

Audience owners, creators, founders with audiences can:

Offer their channel, list, platform

Request rev-share, fees, or reciprocal promo

Monetise or grow their audience while helping launch new products

Clear, Specific Job-To-Be-Done
"I’m about to launch a product — I need warm, trusted audience access without paying Meta/Google or grinding cold DMs."

For the supply side:
"I have an audience or platform — I want fresh things to promote, paid deals, or growth collabs."

Value Proposition
For founders launching:
→ Immediate access to launch partners
→ Save time on outreach
→ Reduce CAC
→ Get warm audience access without ad spend

For audience owners / promoters:
→ Easy dealflow of fresh, aligned products
→ Optional rev-share or paid promo income
→ Reciprocity & social capital

Why it’s viable
No public structured platform exists for this specific moment (GTM partnerships)

High founder pain point (launch visibility)

High willingness to collaborate at this stage

Audience owners always need fresh content/products to share

You can curate for quality early (invite-only, paid posting)

Revenue Model (phased)
Free to browse early → paid posting & access later (MicroAcquire model)

Featured partnership slots (sponsored)

Premium membership for early access

Long term: Concierge intro service, SaaS tooling layer

What’s still missing
The one sharp sentence hook.
Example (rough):
“Find warm, trusted partners to supercharge your next product launch — without cold DMs or paid ads.”

You can tighten this in testing.

Next Steps (when you want to move)
If you want to move on it, you’ll need:

Landing page copy (positioned tightly)

Founder outreach messages to seed the board

Promoter outreach messages to build the other side

Basic Notion / Webflow MVP board (no tech build yet)

This can all be done in a weekend if you want to soft-launch.

You can now park this idea cleanly.
It’s not loose in your head anymore.
You’ve got the shape of it.

You can spin your other plates knowing this is boxed, ready to execute when you choose.
When you’re ready, I’ll help you lift it off the shelf and bring it to life.

Immediate Focus: 
Cold outreach is your wedge.
- ie Cold outreach is killing GTM velocity.
- ie *COLD OUTREACH IS THE ENEMY. HECTO IS THE ALTERNATIVE.

Speed is a supporting claim.
Partner matching is the mechanism.
Distribution access is the ultimate outcome.
