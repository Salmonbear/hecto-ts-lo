- Promoters: Fresh dealflow, rev-share income, reciprocity, social capital

## Applying the Style to Hecto

### Hero Section
**Style:** Large heading, subheading, CTA button, hero image/visual
**Content:**
- H1: "Launch your product to warm, trusted audiences"
- Subhead: "Connect with audience owners, creators, and founders for authentic partnerships — no cold outreach or ad spend required"
- CTA: "Post Your Launch" / "Browse Opportunities"
- Visual: Grid of partner cards or collaboration illustration

### Social Proof Bar
**Style:** Simple logos/avatars in a row
**Content:** "Trusted by founders at [Company logos]" or "Join 500+ founders and audience owners"

### Two-Sided Value Props (Card Grid)
**Style:** 2-column cards with icons/images
**Content:**

**Left Card - For Founders:**
- Icon/image of a founder
- "Launching a Product?"
- List of benefits (immediate partners, save time, reduce CAC, warm access)
- CTA: "Post Your Launch"

**Right Card - For Audience Owners:**
- Icon/image of content creator
- "Have an Audience?"
- List of benefits (fresh products, rev-share, reciprocity)
- CTA: "Browse Launches"

### How It Works (3-Column Grid)
**Style:** 3 cards with numbers/icons
**Content:**
1. **Post Your Need** - Describe your launch, target audience, partnership type
2. **Get Matched** - Audience owners browse and reach out
3. **Launch Together** - Collaborate on email swaps, bundles, shoutouts, or rev-shares

### Partnership Types (Grid of Cards)
**Style:** 6 small cards with icons
**Content:**
- Email Swaps
- Bundle Collaborations
- Shoutouts & Features
- Rev-Share Deals
- Paid Placements
- Product Collabs

### Wavy Blue Section - "Why Hecto?"
**Style:** Blue wavy background like inspiration
**Content:**
- "No more cold DMs. No ad spend. Just warm introductions."
- "The only platform built specifically for GTM partnerships at launch"
- Stats: "X partnerships formed", "X products launched", "X audience reach"

### FAQ Section
**Style:** Expandable accordion cards
**Content:**
- "How is this different from cold outreach?"
- "What types of partnerships work best?"
- "How do I find the right partners?"
- "Is there a cost to post?"

### Testimonial Section

### Final CTA Section
**Style:** Clean white section with centered content

## Color Palette Adaptation

**Primary Blue:** #4A9FF5 (matches inspiration)
**Secondary:** Lighter blue for backgrounds (#F0F8FF)
**Accent:** Darker blue for CTAs (#2D7FC1)
**Text:** Dark gray (#1A1A1A)
**Backgrounds:** White, light blue, occasional dark sections

## Typography Approach

- Large, bold headings (similar to inspiration)
- Clean sans-serif (Inter, Poppins, or similar)
- Plenty of line-height for readability
- Clear hierarchy: H1 > H2 > Body

## Key Differentiators from Generic Marketplaces

- Emphasize "GTM" and "launch" language throughout
- Show it's curated, not chaotic
- Highlight trust and warm introductions
- Position as alternative to ads and cold outreach
- Two-sided benefit messaging (not just seller-focused)

## Implementation Notes

- Keep mobile responsive (cards stack vertically)
- Use subtle animations on scroll (like inspiration)
- Ensure CTAs are prominent but not overwhelming
- Add trust signals (testimonials, stats, logos)
- Consider adding a preview/sample of actual partnership listings

## Next Steps

1. Wireframe each section based on this structure
2. Write final copy for each section
3. Source/create imagery (founder photos, illustrations)
4. Build in Plasmic or code directly
5. A/B test different headline variations
