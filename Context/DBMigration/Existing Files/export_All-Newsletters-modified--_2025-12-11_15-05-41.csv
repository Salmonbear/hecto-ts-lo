Started as an on-line newsletter in 2007, today’s Digest has grown up in every way. NARSOL now publishes four editions of the Digest that circulate bi-monthly.

•	The print edition is supported by hundreds of paid subscribers many of whom are incarcerated in state prisons for sexually based offenses. 
•	Our membership e-edition is published in the form of a preview to the online flipbook and is sent to members, donors, and supporters of our advocacy work. 
•	The full online flipbook is available to everyone through the Digest archives and is typically posted a week or two after the print edition has shipped. 
•	Finally, through the Federal Corrlinks program, currently many hundreds of federal prisoners receive a text-only e-edition. That number continues to grow monthly.

Every issue consists of either 4-8 ""links"" in these topics (accompanied with my thoughts - usually 3-7 sentences) or a longer-form ""story"" (an essay with more of my thoughts on a topic).

Each issue, we'll delve into the stories and trends that have shaped our world and continue to influence our daily lives.

From the mid-century modern movement to the rise of minimalist design, we'll take a closer look at the design styles that have shaped our homes, workplaces, and public spaces. We'll also explore the history of iconic designs and the stories behind the designers who created them.

But our newsletter isn't just about design – we also explore the impact of lifestyle on design and vice versa. We'll take a deep dive into the cultural trends that have influenced design choices over the years, from the hippie movement to the rise of wellness culture. We'll also explore the ways in which design can impact our lives, from creating more productive workspaces to fostering healthier living environments.

If you didn’t already know this, it's set to co-pilot almost all our day-to-day activities.

Side-stepping technical mumbo jumbo as far as possible, I examine the effects of AI on jobs and the workforce, and debate the ethics and moral dilemmas it represents. Rounding up will be a segment outlining the latest research in the field. 

Today, we are at an inflection stage where AI is concerned. I believe that because of its ubiquitous nature, all humans need to understand AI, its applications, and its implications.

It encompasses various aspects, ranging from aesthetic and functional considerations to technical and technological aspects. Design can span across multiple fields, such as industrial design, graphic design, fashion design, furniture design, software design, visual identity design, and many others.

The design process follows several defined stages that a design team goes through to reach the desired outcome. The main steps of the design process include:

Problem Understanding: In this stage, the design team identifies and comprehends the problem that needs to be addressed through the design. User research, needs analysis, and requirements gathering are undertaken to better understand the target audience and their needs.
